		<h1>C++ CBC Programmers Manual</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>
			This document covers usage of the cbc2cxx.h header, which is a lightweight c++ wrapper for libcbc.
			C++ is almost completely backwards compatible with C, so almost all regular C code for the CBC will
			work in C++, including regular libcbc calls such as <pygm>motor(int motor, int speed);</pygm> and 
			<pygm>digital(int port);</pygm>
		</p>
		<h2>Motors (<code>Motor</code>)</h2>
		<p>
			Individual motors are creating instances of the
			<pygm>Motor</pygm> class. The <pygm>Motor</pygm>
			class has a significant amount of similarity to libcbc. For example,
			if we wished to move motor on port 0 at a specific velocity for 1
			second, we could use the <pygm>moveAtVelocity</pygm> method in
			<pygm>Motor</pygm>.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			int main() {
				Motor test(0);
				test.moveAtVelocity(150);
				msleep(1500);
				test.off();
				
				return 0;
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			If you've programmed a CBC in C before, the method
			<pygm>moveAtVelocity</pygm> should look somewhat familiar. In C, we
			can use the <pygm>move_at_velocity</pygm> or <pygm>mav</pygm>
			functions to achieve a similar effect. In C++, though, we don't
			have to supply a port to the method. The <pygm>Motor</pygm> class
			stores the port we supplied to it in the constructor, cleaning our
			code both syntactically and conceptually.
		</p>
		<h2>Servos (<code>Servo</code>)</h2>
		<p>
			Servos are also very simple to use in C++. In the following
			example, we will quickly move a servo on port 1 to position 500,
			then smoothly move it to 1000 over a period of 5 seconds. CBCJVM
			does quite a bit of work behind the scenes to accomplish this for
			us.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			using namespace std;
			
			int main()
			{
				Servo a(1);
				a.setPosition(500);
				
				msleep(500);
				
				cout << "Servo 1 is now at " << a.getPosition() << endl;
				
				return 0;
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Since both scenarios have their obvious uses, CBCJVM allows the
			programmer to pick. In our example, we block. Otherwise, we would be
			disabling the servo before the servo finished moving, which wouldn't
			produce the desired behavior.
		</p>
		<h2>Sensors</h2>
		<p>
			All sensors extend the 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Buttons (<code>namespace Button</code>)
		</h3>
		<p>
			Wrappers for the virtual and physical CBC buttons are found under the <code>Button</code> namespace.
			Buttons implement the <pygm>BooleanSensor</pygm> interface, so you can retrieve the button's
			value using <pygm>getValue</pygm>. 
			
		</p>
		<pygments>
			int main() {
				Button::A a;
				while(!a.getValue());
				
				return 0;
			}
		</pygments>
		<h3>
			Boolean Sensors (<code>cbccore.sensors.digital.IBooleanSensor</code>)
		</h3>
		<p>
			A Boolean sensor can be defined very simply: Anything that can
			return a true or a false value. The method we call to determine this state
			is called <pygm>getValue</pygm> All digital sensors fall under this
			category, so we will discuss them first. In the following example,
			we will wait for a touch sensor on port 15 to be pressed before
			printing a message.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.sensors.digital.*;
			
			public class TouchSensors {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Touch sensor = new Touch(15);
					while(!sensor.getValue()) Thread.yield(); // Wait until sensor is pressed
					System.out.println("Touched!");
				}
			}
		</pygments>

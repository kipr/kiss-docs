<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Understanding_systems">Understanding systems</span></h2>
<p>We conceptualize the world around us in terms of systems. A <b>system</b> is a web of interconnected objects working together in tandem. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory" class="extiw" title="w:Systems theory">systems theory</a>, a system is set out as a single entity within a world surrounded by an environment. A system interacts with its surrounding environment using messages of two distinct types:</p>
<ul><li><b>inputs:</b> messages received from the surrounding environment; and,</li>
<li><b>outputs:</b> messages given back to the surrounding environment.</li>
</ul><p><br></p>

Life is a complicated mess of interconnected objects sending signals and messages. See the illustration below in figure 2 demonstrating a complex system for an economic ecosphere for a single company. Imagine what this system diagram would be like if you were to add a few more companies and their sub-systems. Computer software systems in general are a complex web of further interconnected <b>sub-systems</b> &#8211; where each sub-systems may or may not be divided into further sub-systems. Each sub-system communicates with others using <b>feedback</b> messages &#8211; that is, <i>inputs</i> and <i>outputs</i>.</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_process_of_abstraction">The process of abstraction</span></h2>
<p>Programming is essentially thinking of solutions to problems in real life as a system. With any programming language, you need to know how to address real-life problems into something that could be accurately represented within a computer system. In order to begin programming with the Java programming language (or in fact, with any programming language), a programmer must first understand the basics of abstraction.</p>
<p><b>Abstraction</b> is the process of <i>representing</i> real-life problems and object into your programs.</p>
<p>Suppose a novelist, a painter and a programmer were asked to <i>abstract</i> (i.e., <i>represent</i>) a real-life object in their work. Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is <i>an animal</i>. Abstraction for a novelist would include writing the description of the animal whilst the painter would draw a picture of the animal &#8211; but what about a computer programmer?</p>
<p>The Java programming language uses a programming paradigm called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" class="extiw" title="w:Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming (OOP)</a>, which shows you exactly what a programmer needs to be doing. According to OOP, every object or problem in real-life can be translated into a virtual object within your computer system.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Thinking_in_objects">Thinking in objects</span></h3>
<p>In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an <b>object</b> within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">class</span> Animal <span class="br0">{</span> <span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The code above creates a space within your code where you can start <i>defining</i> an object; this space is called a <b>class (<i>or</i> type) definition</b>. All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets &#8211; anything you write within these curly brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called <code>Animal</code> for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., <code>class</code>). Such predefined words in the Java language are known as <b>keywords</b> and make up the grammar for the language (known as <b>programming syntax</b>).</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Understanding_class_definitions_and_types">Understanding class definitions and types</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" class="extiw" title="w:Aristotle">Aristotle</a> was perhaps the first person to think of abstract types or typologies of objects. He started calling them classes &#8211; e.g., classes of birds, classes of mammals. Class definition therefore serve the purpose well in defining the common characteristics or types of object you would be creating. Upon declaring a class definition, you can create objects based on those definitions. In order to do so however, you need to write a special syntax that goes like this:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
Animal dog <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> Animal<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The code above effectively creates an object called <code>dog</code> based on the class definition for <code>Animal</code>. In non-programmer parlance, the code above would translate into something akin to saying, "Create a new object <code>dog</code> of type <code>Animal</code>." A single class definition enables you to create multiple objects as the code below indicates:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
Animal dog <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> Animal<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
Animal cat <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> Animal<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
Animal camel <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> Animal<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Basically, you just have to write the code for your class or type definition once, and then use it to create countless numbers of objects based on that specification. Although you might not grasp the importance of doing so, but this little exercise saves you a lot of time (a luxury that was not readily available to programmers in the pre-Java days).</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Expanding_your_class_definitions">Expanding your class definitions</span></h3>
<p>Although, each object you create from a class definition is essentially the same, there has to be a way of differentiating those objects in your code. Object properties (or simply <b>properties</b>) are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define properties that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two properties: <b>name</b> (a common name given to any one of these animals) and <b>legs</b> (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">class</span> Animal <span class="br0">{</span>
 
  <span class="kw3">String</span> name<span class="sy0">;</span>
  <span class="kw4">int</span> legs<span class="sy0">;</span>
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the code above you defined two object properties:</p>
<ul><li>a property called <code>name</code> of type <code>String</code>; and,</li>
<li>a property called <code>legs</code> of type <code>int</code>.</li>
</ul><p>These special pre-defined types are called <b>data types</b>. The <code>String</code> data type is used for properties that can hold <i>textual</i> values like names, while the <code>int</code> (integer) data type is used for properties that can hold <i>numeric</i> values</p>
<table align="center" style="border:solid 1px lightgray; padding:8px; background: #fdfdfd"><tr><td style="text-align:center; padding:2px 8px;">
<div style="color:#2a7fff; border-bottom:solid 1px #ddd; padding-bottom:4px;"><b>Figure 3:</b> In order to denote the <code>Animal</code> object as a system within the Java Environment,<br>
you present it as such. Note how properties are presented.</div>

</div>
</td>
</tr></table><p><br>
In order to demonstrate how properties work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
Animal animal1 <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> Animal<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
Animal animal2 <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> Animal<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
 
animal1.<span class="me1">name</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="st0">"dog"</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
animal1.<span class="me1">legs</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="nu0">4</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
 
animal2.<span class="me1">name</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="st0">"duck"</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
animal2.<span class="me1">legs</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="nu0">2</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can access the properties of your created objects by using the <code>.</code> (dot) or <b>membership operator</b>. In the example above, we created two objects: <code>animal1</code> and <code>animal2</code> of type <code>Animal</code>. And since, we had established that each <code>Animal</code> has two properties namely <code>name</code> and <code>legs</code>, we accessed and modified these properties for each of our objects using the membership operator to set the two apart. By declaring different values for different objects, we can manipulate their current <b>state</b>. So, for instance:</p>
<ul><li>the <code>animal1</code> object is a <code>"dog"</code> with <code>4</code> legs to walk with; while,</li>
<li>the <code>animal2</code> object is a <code>"duck"</code> with <code>2</code> legs to walk with.</li>
</ul><p>What sets the two objects apart is their current state. Both the objects have different states and thus stand out as two different objects even though they were created from the same template or class definition.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_behavior_to_objects">Adding behavior to objects</span></h3>
<p>At this point, your objects do nothing more than declare a bunch of properties. Being a system, your objects should have the ability to interact with its environment and other systems as well. To add this capability for interaction, you need to add interactive behavior to your object class definitions as well. Such behavior is added to class definitions using a programming construct called <b>method</b>.</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>Animal</code>, you require your virtual representation of an animal to be able to move through its environment. Let's say, as an analogy, you want your <code>Animal</code> object to be able to walk in its environment. Thus, you need to add a method named <code>walk</code> to our object. To do so, we need to write the following code:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">class</span> Animal <span class="br0">{</span>
 
  <span class="kw3">String</span> name<span class="sy0">;</span>
  <span class="kw4">int</span> legs<span class="sy0">;</span>
 
  <span class="kw4">void</span> walk<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span> <span class="br0">}</span>
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As you write this code, one thing becomes immediately apparent. Just like the class description, a method has curly brackets as well. Generally, curly brackets are used to define an area (or <b>scope</b>) within your object. So the first set of curly brackets defined a scope for your class definition called the <b>class-level scope</b>. This new set of curly brackets alongside a method defines a scope for the further definition of your method called the <b>method-level scope</b>.</p>
<p>In this instance, the name of our method is <code>walk</code>. Notice however that the name of our method also features a set of round brackets as well. More than just being visual identifiers for methods, these round brackets are used to provide our methods with additional input information called <b>arguments</b>.</p>
<p>A method therefore enables an object to:</p>
<ol><li>Accept input: Receive some argument(s);</li>
<li>Process information: work on the received argument(s) within its curly brackets; and,</li>
<li>Generate ouput: <i>occasionally</i>, return something back.</li>
</ol><p>In essence, methods are what makes an object behave more like a system.</p>
<p>Notice the keyword <code>void</code> before the name of the method &#8211; this tells us that the method <code>walk</code> returns <i>nothing</i>. You can set a method to return any data type &#8211; it can be a <b>String</b> or an <b>int</b> as well.</p>
<table align="center" style="border:solid 1px lightgray; padding:8px; background: #fdfdfd"><tr><td style="text-align:center; padding:2px 8px;">
<div style="color:#2a7fff; border-bottom:solid 1px #ddd; padding-bottom:4px;"><b>Figure 4:</b> The <code>Animal</code> object can now be denoted as having a interaction behavior within the Java Environment<br>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_process_of_encapsulation">The process of encapsulation</span></h2>
<p>By now, we thoroughly understand that any object can interact with its environment and in turn be influenced by it. In our example, the <code>Animal</code> object exposed certain properties &#8211; <code>name</code> and <code>legs</code>, and a method &#8211; <code>walk()</code> to be used by the environment to manipulate the object. This form of exposure is implicit. Using the Java programming language, a programmer has the power to define the level of access other objects and the environment has on a certain object.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Using_access_modifiers">Using access modifiers</span></h3>
<p>Alongside declaring and defining objects, their properties and methods, a programmer also has the ability to define the levels of access on those elements. This is done using keywords known as <b>access modifiers</b>.</p>
<p>Let's modify our example to demonstrate this effect:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">class</span> Animal <span class="br0">{</span>
 
  <span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw3">String</span> name<span class="sy0">;</span>
  <span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> legs<span class="sy0">;</span>
 
  <span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw4">void</span> walk<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span> <span class="br0">}</span>
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By declaring all properties and methods <code>public</code>, we have ensured that they can be used outside the scope of the <code>Animal</code> class. This means that any other object (other than <code>Animal</code>) has access to these member elements. However, to restrict access to certain member elements of a class, we can always use the <code>private</code> access modifier (as demonstrated below).</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">class</span> Animal <span class="br0">{</span>
 
  <span class="kw1">private</span> <span class="kw3">String</span> name<span class="sy0">;</span>
  <span class="kw1">private</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> legs<span class="sy0">;</span>
 
  <span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw4">void</span> walk<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span> <span class="br0">}</span>
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, the properties <code>name</code> and <code>legs</code> can only be accessed within the scope of the <code>Animal</code> class. No object outside the scope of this class can access these two properties. However, since the <code>walk()</code> method still has <code>public</code> access, it can manipulated by actors and objects outside the scope of this class. Access modifiers are not just limited to properties or methods, it can be used for class definitions as well (as is demonstrated below).</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw1">class</span> Animal <span class="br0">{</span>

  <span class="kw1">private</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> legs<span class="sy0">;</span>
 
  <span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw4">void</span> walk<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span> <span class="br0">}</span>

</ul><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_of_your_first_Java_program">Analysis of your first Java program</span></h3>
<p>In the code for your first Java program, you created a class called <code>FirstProgram</code> which serves as a virtual abstraction model for our program. You could have named this anything but we chose the name <code>FirstProgram</code> in order to highlight the fact that this abstraction serves as the very first program we create in Java.</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw1">class</span> FirstProgram <span class="br0">{</span> <span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice how we placed the <code>public</code> access modifier next to the name for the class definition. This tells us that the class is accessible by the Java environment it exists within. In our case, this environment is the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) itself, which would have direct access to the <code>FirstProgram</code> class and all its <code>public</code> member properties, fields and methods.</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw1">class</span> FirstProgram <span class="br0">{</span>

<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Therefore, when we declare the <code>main(...)</code> method, we make sure that this method is accessible to the JRE using the <code>public</code> access modifier. This particular method has some interesting features associated with it. We can see that the method itself returns nothing (as is indicated by the <code>void</code> keyword) but the method accepts arguments <code>args</code> of type <code>String[]</code>. The square brackets <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> tells us that this the <code>args</code> argument is a list of type <code>String</code>, therefore instead of just one <code>String</code>, this variable can hold several <code>String</code> elements. Such variables are called <b>arrays</b>.</p>
<p>Finally, within the body of the main method, we have written a single line of code:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw3">System</span>.<span class="me1">out</span>.<span class="me1">println</span><span class="br0">(</span><span class="st0">"Hello World!"</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command is called a <b>print statement</b> and is used to print out or display stuff on the command-line application interface. It's a slightly complicated routine to write the whole statement but you get used to writing it in your programs. We will be explaining this line and other <code>System</code> commands in a later chapter.</p>

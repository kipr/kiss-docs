<p>The <b>Java Programming</b> Wikibook is a shared effort in amassing a comprehensive guide of the complete Java platform - from programming advice and tutorials for the desktop computer to programming on mobile phones. The information presented in this book has been conceptualised with the combined efforts of various <a href="Authors_&amp;_Contributors.html" title="Java Programming/Authors &amp; Contributors">authors and contributors</a>, and anonymous editors.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this book is to teach the Java programming language to an audience of beginners, but its progressive layout of tutorials increasing in complexity, it can be just as helpful for intermediate and experienced programmers. Thus, this book is meant to be used as:</p>
<ul><li>a collection of tutorials building upon one another in a progressive manner;</li>
<li>a guidebook for efficient programming with the Java programming language; and,</li>
<li>a comprehensive manual resource for the advanced programmer.</li>
</ul><p>This book is intended to be used in conjunction with various other online resources, such as:</p>
<ul><li>the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html">Java platform API documentation</a>;</li>
<li>the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/index.html">official Java website</a>; and,</li>
<li>active Java communities online, such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://home.java.net">Java.net</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.javaranch.com">JavaRanch</a>, etc.</li>
</ul><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Who_should_read_this_book.3F">Who should read this book?</span></h2>
<p>Every thing you would need to know to write computer programs would be explained in this book. By the time you finish reading, you will find yourself proficient enough to tackle just about anything in Java and programs written using it. This book serves as the first few stepping stones of many you would need to cross the unfriendly waters of computer programming. We have put a lot of emphasis in structuring this book in a way that lets you start programming from scratch, with Java as your preferred language of choice. This book is designed for you if any one of the following is true.</p>
<ul><li>You are relatively new to programming and have heard how easy it is to learn Java.</li>
<li>You had some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" class="extiw" title="w:BASIC">BASIC</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" class="extiw" title="w:Pascal (programming language)">Pascal</a> in school, and have a grasp of basic programming and logic.</li>
<li>You already know and have been introduced to programming in earlier versions of Java.</li>
<li>You are an experienced developer and know how to program in other languages like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" class="extiw" title="w:C++">C++</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic" class="extiw" title="w:Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" class="extiw" title="w:Python (programming language)">Python</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" class="extiw" title="w:Ruby (programming language)">Ruby</a>.</li>
<li>You've heard that Java is great for web applications and web services programming.</li>
</ul><p>Although, this book is generally meant to be for programmers who are beginning to learn programming; it can be highly beneficial for intermediate and advanced programmers who may have missed up on some vital information. By the end of this book, you would be able to solve any complicated problem and tackle it using the best of your learnt skills in Java. Once you finish, you are also encouraged to take upon ambitious programming projects of your own as you certainly would be able to do that as well.</p>
<p>This book assumes that the reader has no prior knowledge of programming in Java, or for that matter, any object-oriented programming language. The book makes it easier to understand development methodology as one reads through the book with practical examples and exercises at the end of each topic and module. Although, if you are a complete beginner, we would suggest that you move slowly through this book and practice each exercise at your pace.</p>

</dl><p>In order to make use of the content in this book, you would need to follow along each and every tutorial rather than simply reading through the book. But to do so, you would need access to a computer with the <b>Java platform</b> installed on it &#8211; the Java platform is the basic prerequisite for <i>running</i> and <i>developing</i> Java code, thus it is divided into two essential software:</p>
<ul><li>the <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</b>, which is needed to <i>run</i> Java applications and applets; and,</li>
<li>the <b>Java Development Kit (JDK)</b>, which is needed to <i>develop</i> those Java applications and applets.</li>
</ul><p>However as a developer, you would only require the JDK which comes equipped with a JRE as well. Given below are installation instruction for the JDK for various operating systems:</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="For_Windows">For Windows</span></h3>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Download_instructions">Download instructions</span></h4>
<p>Some Windows based systems come built-in with the JRE, however for the purposes of writing Java code by following the tutorials in this book, you would require the JDK nevertheless. To acquire the latest JDK (version 7), you can manually <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">download the Java software</a> from the Oracle website.</p>
<p>For the convenience of our readers, the following table presents direct links to the latest JDK for the Windows operating system.</p>

</tr></table><p>You must follow the instructions for the setup installer wizard step-by-step with the default settings to ensure that Java is properly installed on your system. Once the setup is completed, it is highly recommended to restart your Windows operating system.</p>
<p>If you kept the default settings for the setup installer wizard, you JDK should now be installed at <b>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01</b>. You would require the location to your <b>bin</b> folder at a later time &#8211; this is located at <b>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01\bin</b></p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Updating_environment_variables_.28Optional.29">Updating environment variables (Optional)</span></h4>
<p>In order for you to start using the JDK compiler utility with the Command Prompt, you would need to set the environment variables that points to the <b>bin</b> folder of your recently installed JDK. Follow the steps below to permanently include your Java platform to your environment variables.</p>

<p>Once you have successfully installed the JDK on your system, you are ready to program code in the Java programming language. However, to write code, you would need a decent text editor. Windows comes with a default text editor by default &#8211; <b>Notepad</b>. In order to use notepad to write code in Java, you need to follow the steps below:</p>

</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">2.</td>
<td>Once the <b>Notepad</b> application has fired up, you can use the editor to write code for the Java programming language.</td>
</tr></table><p>The problem with <b>Notepad</b> however is that it does not support developer-friendly features, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting" class="extiw" title="w:Syntax highlighting">syntax highlighting</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion" class="extiw" title="w:Code completion">code completion</a>. These features are a vital part of the exercise of writing code. Nevertheless, there are a variety of different open-source editors available as alternatives to <b>Notepad</b> that support these features.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the tutorials in this book, the most recommended editor is the <b>Notepad++</b>, a free and open-source fully integrated text editor that supports syntax highlighting and code completion. You need to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org">download the latest version of Notepad++</a> in order to start writing code with the editor.</p>

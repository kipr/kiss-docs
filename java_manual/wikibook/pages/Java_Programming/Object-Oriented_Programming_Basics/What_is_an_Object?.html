<p>The phrase &#8216;Object-Oriented Programming&#8217; quite literally means &#8216;programming based around objects&#8217;. No wonder, the most basic knowledge you must grasp regarding OOP must certainly to be of objects. To better understand the paradigm of object-oriented programming, you need to understand fully the concept of objects. Much as in everyday life, an object can be a representation of any one thing &#8211; it can be a tree, a chair or even a dog. You would gather observations of real-world objects and would model these very objects in your programming environment. That's how object-oriented programming generally works.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Defining_Objects:_States_and_Behaviors">Defining Objects: States and Behaviors</span></h2>
<p>All objects (a dog, a book or even you) have two distinct characteristics. They all have a state and they all perform certain behaviors. In the case of a dog, its state would be denoted by its <i>current</i> properties, e.g., its name, color of its fur, it being hungry, etc. This same dog may also have certain behaviors that it can perform such as barking, eating, wagging its tail, and so on. Say, if you were to feed the dog, the dog would perform a behavior, i.e., eating. Performing this behavior would ensure that the dog's state be changed as the dog is no longer hungry. Did you notice what happened there? The behavior performed by the dog just changed the state of the dog.</p>
<p>Let's take another example &#8211; you. You have a certain state (your name, color of your eyes, your age, etc.) and you certainly have a few behaviors that you perform (eating, drinking, etc.) If we are to understand how object-orientation works, we need to teach ourselves to identify such states and behaviors in different objects so as to create similar objects in our programming models. Remember, programming on a computer is just an abstraction of the real world. You get inspiration from things around you. The more you are adept at identifying states and behaviors in everyday objects, the more keen your eyes gets in modeling those things in programming models.</p>
<p>Let's do a simple exercise. Whilst reading this text, take a look around yourself and observe as many objects in your immediate surroundings as you can. Identify and determine what possible states those objects could have, and what possible behaviors they can perform. Write down those observations as you go. The more you practice such observational skills to objects around you, the more you would be accustomed to the world of object-oriented programming. Gathering all that we've learnt so far, we can now formally define an object.</p>

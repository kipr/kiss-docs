				<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Networking is the act of connecting two or more computers together so that they can communicate. Each computer has an address, known as an <i>IP Address</i> which they use to find the other computers on the network. Each computer also has a set of <i>ports</i> where each message is placed. Think of it as a post office. The post office is the computer. Each piece of mail, or packet in the computing world, is sorted out into a PO box, which would be analogous to a port. Imagine if there was only one box. Everyone would have a tough time getting to their mail! In this way, the data keeps from getting lost or overwritten by other data.</p>
<p>Unlike a post office, each port on a computer is used for different things. Port 80, for example, is the port for web browsing, and port 25 is the port for SMTP e-mail.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, though, direct computer-to-computer conversing almost never happens. Most of the conversing is between a server and a client.</p>
<p>A server is just like a matre'd at a fancy restaurant. The client asks for a file that the server has, and the server brings it to the client.</p>
<p>In this chapter we are going to make both- both a server for files and a client for files.</p>

<p>Learning a computer programming language is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/akin" class="extiw" title="wikt:akin">akin to</a> a toddler's first few steps towards an upright walk. You stumble and you fall but when you start walking, you take upon it as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/second_nature" class="extiw" title="wikt:second nature">second nature</a>. Learning to program is similar in many ways to learning to walk. However once you start programming, you never cease to evolve. Learn one programming language and you know them all.</p>
<p>This book is a concentrated effort in trying to get you to take your baby steps towards programming in the Java&#8482; programming language. Although this book is primarily meant to act as a learning aid for beginners, it can equally be helpful as a reference manual and guide for the intermediate and experienced programmers. The book is laid out in such a manner that with each successive chapter, the complexity of programming constructs increase. Thus, programmers are constantly challenged to develop their skills with a progressive learning curve.</p>

<p>If you have chosen Java as your first programming language, be assured that Java happens to also be the first choice for educational programs in many universities and colleges. Its simple and intuitive <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syntax" class="extiw" title="wikt:syntax">syntax</a> (that's grammar for programming languages) helps beginners feel at ease with complex programming constructs in no time.</p>
<p>But be aware, Java is not just any <i>basic</i> programming language. In fact, NASA used Java as the driving force (quite literally) behind its Mars Rover missions. Computers, mobile phones, set-top boxes, and even digital television sets can all be programmed using the Java programming language. Robots, air traffic control systems and the self-checkout barcode scanners in your favourite supermarkets are all being programmed in Java.</p>

<p>By now, you might truly be able to grasp the power of the Java programming language &#8211; there is still lots more you can do with Java. Not every programmer gets to program applications that take unmanned vehicles onto other planets. Software that we encounter in our daily life is somewhat humble in that respect. Software programs and applications written in Java however cover vast arena of the computing ecosphere. Here are just some examples of the ubiquitous nature of Java applications in real-life:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org" class="extiw" title="w:OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, a desktop office management suite that rivals the Microsoft Office suite has been written in Java.</li>
<li>The popular building game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft" class="extiw" title="w:Minecraft">Minecraft</a> is also written in Java.</li>
<li>Online browser-based games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runescape" class="extiw" title="w:Runescape">Runescape</a>, a 3D massively multi-player online role playing game (MMORPG), run on graphics routines, 3D rendering and networking capabilities powered by the Java programming language.</li>
<li>Two of the world's renowned digital video recorders, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo" class="extiw" title="w:TiVo">TiVo</a> and BSkyB's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky%2B" class="extiw" title="w:Sky+">Sky+</a> use built-in live television recording software to record, rewind and play your favourite television shows. These applications make extensive use of the Java programming language.</li>
</ul><p>The above mentioned application illustrates the reach and ubiquity of Java applications. Here's another fact &#8211; almost 80% of mobile phone vendors adopt Java as their primary platform for the development of applications. The second most widely used mobile-based operating system, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" class="extiw" title="w:Android (operating system)">Android</a>, uses Java as one of its key application platforms &#8211; developers are encouraged to develop application for Android in the Java programming language.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_can_Java_not_do.3F">What can Java <i>not</i> do?</span></h3>
<p>Well, to be honest, there is nothing that Java can not do. You can program just about anything in Java. This book would however get you acquainted with the basics of the language in order for you to create that masterpiece of a software you dream of creating one day.</p>
<p>People have written operating systems in Java, they have programmed robots in the language and managed power stations and conveyor belts in factories; thus, you can do anything and everything with Java. Your applications and code need not fear any bounds because with Java, possibilities are endless &#8211; all you need is <i>creativity</i>.</p>

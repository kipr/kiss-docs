<p><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> (<b>OOP</b>) is a programming paradigm that takes examples from real-world object to create to design and create applications and computer programs. Java is also an object-oriented programming language, hence it follows basic concepts found in every OOP language (e.g., C++, C#, SmallTalk, Ruby etc.) If you've worked with any of these mentioned languages, you might want to skip this section of the book.</p>
<p>If, however, you are new to the concept of object-oriented programming, we would urge you to learn the basic concepts of OO programming before you begin writing any more code. Throughout this lesson, we will try to understand concepts common to most object-oriented programming languages, introducing things like objects, classes, abstration, polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulations, interfaces and packages. We would continue exploring these concepts, while simultaneously learning the Java syntax.</p>

<p>An object, within a computer program, is a unit of abstraction with a certain state and behavior. Objects are usually modeled around and based upon things you may find in everyday life. Throughout this section, we would look into what an object really is in the context of Object-Oriented Programming and be introduced to further concepts like encapsulation.</p>

(does not exist)">What is a Class?</a></span></h2>
<p>Once we've fully understood what an object is, we can learn more about how to create them. Classes, in OO programming, are generally just blueprints from which objects are created. This section would define how to create a Class blueprint that would effectively model an object and its state and behavior. Here we will be introduced to concepts like abstraction and polymorphism.</p>

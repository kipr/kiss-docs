<p>In accordance with some of the other books on Wikibooks, this page is for suggesting and tracking ongoing maintenance for the book <i><a href="../Java_Programming.html" title="Java Programming">Java Programming</a></i>. If you want to add another suggestion to the list below that isn't already there, go ahead. If you have a problem with one of the suggestions or want to remove one, please discuss the reason why on the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Java_Programming/Todo" title="Talk:Java Programming/Todo">talk page</a> first.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Pages_Needing_Cleanup">Pages Needing Cleanup</span></h2>
<p>Please add pages that require cleanup and state what is needed here.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Suggestions">Suggestions</span></h2>
<ul><li>Get rid of all the table of content (TOC) templates.</li>
<li>The book needs to have dedicated sections. Your <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Java_Programming/Todo" title="Talk:Java Programming/Todo">suggestions</a> are welcome.
<ul><li>I would certainly think it a good idea adding the sections beginner, intermediate and advance.
<ul><li>Why can't we have a table of contents and index that tie together the entire book as a reference, and then three extra pages as road-maps for "Begginer", "Intermediate" and "Advanced"&#160;?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="New_Layout">New Layout</span></h2>
<p>I'm going to have a crack at suggesting a possible outline for the book.</p>
<ul><li><b>Introduction/Preface</b> - Contains introduction material to the book, including mentions of contributors and styles and conventions used throughout.</li>
<li><b>Setup</b> - Start preparing the users' computer, installing JDK and explaining the technology that is Java, I'd like to see some mentions of other operating systems such as Unix and Unix Like systems seeing as Java is designed to be a cross platform language.</li>
<li><b>Beginner</b> - basic program flow, get the user used to the syntax of Java, maybe treat this chapter as an introduction to programming in general, giving an introduction to object orientated programming.</li>
<li><b>Intermediate</b> - this could be a good starting point for people who have programmed before, but switching to Java, talking about various core aspects and features of the API.</li>
<li><b>Advance</b> - Revisiting some topics mentioned before, but in greater depth. Talking about things like RMI, Corba.</li>
<li><b>Index</b></li>
<li><b>Appendix</b> - Keywords, references, bibliography and other stuff worth mentioning</li>

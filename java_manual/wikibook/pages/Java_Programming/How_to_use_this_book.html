				<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>This book as a reference book of the Java language and its related technologies. Its goal is to give a complete picture of Java and its technologies. While the book can be read from the beginning to end, it is also designed to have individual sections that can be read independently. To help find information quickly, navigation boxes are given in the online version for access to individual topics.</p>
<p>This book is divided to sections. Pages are grouped together into section topics. To make this book expendable in the future via the addition of new sections, the sections navigation-wide are independent from each other. Each section can be considered as a mini book by itself. Pages that belong to the same topic can be navigated by the links on the right hand side.</p>
<p>This book is divided into sections. It contains the following sections so far:</p>
<dl><dt>Beginner Topics</dt>
<dd>Introduces the language to the reader by giving a history, how Java evolved and how it is still evolving. It explains everything that a programmer needs to know.</dd>
<dd>It also gives a reference list of the Java <a href="Keywords.html" title="Java Programming/Keywords">keywords</a></dd>
</dl><dl><dt>User Interface Topics</dt>
<dd>Gives a background about the different GUI's that exist with Java, with a history of their evolution. This section assumes that the reader knows Java well enough to start creating GUI applications in Java.</dd>
</dl><dl><dt>Advanced Topics</dt>
<dd>The advanced topics deal with features not often used, like JINI or JNDI. Most programmers do not need to know these features, but they may be necessary in certain applications.</dd>
</dl><dl><dt>Extra Reading</dt>
<dd>While not an essential part of Java, this section gives information that makes it easier to develop good applications within Java.</dd>
</dl><dl><dt>Appendixes</dt>
<dd>This section provides additional, but minor information concerning Java.</dd>

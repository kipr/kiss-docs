		Manual Version 1.0, by Braden McDorman (bmcdorman@kipr.org)
		<br/>
		<h1>Java Programmers Manual</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Java is an object-oriented imperative language that has a good deal of
			influence from other popular languages like C and C++. The first part of
			this document will introduce you to the language, then we will explore
			CBCJVM, which is the Java library that enables robotics programming.
			This document will assume you have a working understanding of C programming.
		</p>
		<h2>What is an Object Oriented Language?</h2>
		<p>
			The "object" is the fundamental unit in an Object Oriented programming language.
			An object stores both variables (referred to as instance variables)
			and methods (functions that act on those variables or perform actions specific to the object.)
			A good example of this is an actual object, like a dog. A dog has a set of properties, such as color
			and position. It also has actions like bark and walk. Let's model a dog with these properties
			in Java.
		</p>
		<h2>An Object Oriented Pet</h2>
		<pygments>
			class Dog {
				
				// The dog's position, represented as (x, y, z)
				private int x;
				private int y;
				private int z;
				
				private String color; // Holds the dog's color
				
				public void bark() {
					System.out.println("Woof!"); // Print "Woof"
				}
				
				public void walk() {
					x++; // This dog can only walk in the positive x direction
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Let's look at the previous code listing in more detail. The first thing we see is the <pygm>class</pygm>
			keyword. This means we are about to define a "blueprint" for our object. A class
			defines what the object can do and the properties it has, but it doesn't actually
			create an object in memory. If we wanted to create an object based off this class, we
			could write the following: <pygm>Dog buddy = new Dog();</pygm> (More on this later.)
			The next keyword that might look foreign is <pygm>private</pygm>, which is part of the
			group of <em>visibility</em> keywords, which include <pygm>public</pygm>, <pygm>protected</pygm>,
			and <pygm>private</pygm>. These visibility keywords allow us to modify what
			the user of our class can see. For example, if we attempted to access the <pygm>x</pygm>
			property of <pygm>buddy</pygm>, Java would produce an error. However, since our methods
			are public, some one can easily call <pygm>bark()</pygm> on <pygm>buddy</pygm>. In Java,
			it is usually considered bad practice to have <pygm>public</pygm> instance variables. We will
			discuss <pygm>protected</pygm> at a latter time.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, how would we actually go about using <pygm>Dog</pygm>? Let's take a look at another example.
		</p>
		<h3>The Main Method</h3>
		<pygments>
			class Main {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Dog buddy = new Dog();
					buddy.bark(); // Print Woof
					
					buddy.walk();
					buddy.walk();
					buddy.walk();
					// The x property of buddy should now equal 3
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Everything in Java must belong to a class, so our <pygm>main</pygm> method must as well.
			We call this class <pygm>Main</pygm> because CBCJVM expects your <pygm>main</pygm> method to
			belong to the <pygm>Main</pygm> class. This however is not a restriction imposed by regular Java.
			This main is slightly different from the C main you're probably used to, so let's discuss
			it for a second. <pygm>public static void main(String[] args)</pygm> Starts with the
			<pygm>public</pygm> keyword, which we have already discussed. The next keyword is
			<pygm>static</pygm>, which we will defer for later discussion. <pygm>void</pygm> means
			our main method doesn't have a return value. Next is the name of the method, <pygm>main</pygm>.
			This is followed by the parameter list. <pygm>String[] args</pygm> allows a user to "pass" arguments
			to our program. This, however, will never be the case with CBC development, so we will not discuss
			it in more detail. While we don't use <pygm>args</pygm>, we <em>must</em> still have it in our <pygm>main</pygm>
			definition. If you were to omit <pygm>args</pygm>, Java would fail to find your main method.
			We use the dot operator to access public members of any object. The syntax for the dot operator is as follows:
			<pygm>[object variable].[public member]</pygm>.
		</p>
		<h3>Changing Instance Variables</h3>
		<p>
			Let's expand on our <pygm>Dog</pygm> class a bit. Let's add accessors and mutators for our instance variables.
			An accessor is usually a one line method that takes no parameters, that simply returns a variable. A mutator is
			a one line method that takes one parameter, and assigns the instance variable to the parameter. Let's make our
			position both mutable and accessible.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class Dog {
				
				// The dog's position, represented as (x, y, z)
				private int x;
				private int y;
				private int z;
				
				private String color; // Holds the dog's color
				
				public void bark() {
					System.out.println("Woof!"); // Print "Woof"
				}
				
				public void walk() {
					x++; // This dog can only walk in the positive x direction
				}
				
				public int getX() { // Note: Accessors are usually prefixed with "get"
					return x;
				}
				
				public void setX(int newX) { // Mutators are usually prefixed with "set"
					x = newX;
				}
				
				public int getY() {
					return y;
				}
				
				public void setY(int newY) {
					y = newY;
				}
				
				public int getZ() {
					return z;
				}
				
				public void setZ(int newZ) {
					z = newZ;
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			This may seem like a lot of code to do something trivial, but this is accepted convention in Java.
			<i>Sigh</i>. Let's update our <pygm>main</pygm> method to print the X value after walking three times.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class Main {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Dog buddy = new Dog();
					buddy.bark(); // Print Woof
					
					buddy.walk();
					buddy.walk();
					buddy.walk();
					// The x property of buddy should now equal 3
					
					System.out.println("Buddy's X position is now " + buddy.getX());
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<h3>Abstraction</h3>
		<p>
			So we have a dog that can walk in the positive x direction, but what if we want a
			cat to do the same? Why not just rename <pygm>Dog</pygm> to something more generic, like
			<pygm>Pet</pygm>? This might be an excellent idea, but let's modify the requirements a bit.
			A cat has a property called <pygm>lives</pygm>, and methods to mutate that value, so we need a class.
			specific to it. I'm sure you're tempted to create a new class and copy + paste our old walking code 
			into it, but Java provides us with a better way. This is called abstraction. Let's introduce a new 
			class called <pygm>WalkingPet</pygm>. This class is going to have all of the walking and position 
			code from <pygm>Dog</pygm>.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class WalkingPet {
				private int x;
				private int y;
				private int z;
				
				public void walk() {
					x++;
				}
				
				public int getX() { // Note: Accessors are usually prefixed with "get"
					return x;
				}
				
				public void setX(int newX) { // Mutators are usually prefixed with "set"
					x = newX;
				}
				
				public int getY() {
					return y;
				}
				
				public void setY(int newY) {
					y = newY;
				}
				
				public int getZ() {
					return z;
				}
				
				public void setZ(int newZ) {
					z = newZ;
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Now we can define our <pygm>Dog</pygm> and <pygm>Cat</pygm> by
			<i>extending</i> <pygm>WalkingPet</pygm>. We do this with the
			<pygm>extends</pygm> keyword, which follows the class name during
			the definition of a class. Let's now define these two classes.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class Dog extends WalkingPet {
				private String color; // Holds the dog's color
				
				public void bark() {
					System.out.println("Woof!"); // Print "Woof"
				}
			}
			
			class Cat extends WalkingPet {
				private int lives = 9;
				
				public int getLives() {
					return lives;
				}
				
				public void loseLives(int num) {
					lives = lives - num;
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Great! Now let's modify our driver (which is a fancy name for main) to create
			both a cat and dog.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class Main {
				// This method can take any WalkingPet, be it cat or dog. How cool is that?
				public static void walkPet(WalkingPet pet, int times) {
					for(int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
						pet.walk();
					}
				}
				
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Dog buddy = new Dog();
					Cat grayson = new Cat();
					
					buddy.bark(); // Print Woof
					
					walkPet(buddy, 2);
					
					walkPet(grayson, 1);
					
					System.out.println("Buddy's X position is now " + buddy.getX() +
						", while grayson's is " + grayson.getX());
					
					System.out.println("Grayson started with " + grayson.getLives() + " lives.");
					
					grayson.loseLives(2);
					
					System.out.println("But now only has " + grayson.getLives() + ". Bummer.");
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			This will output: <br />
			<code>
				Buddy's X position is now 2, while grayson's is 1 <br />
				Grayson started with 9 lives. <br />
				But now only has 7. Bummer. <br />
			</code>
		</p>
		<h3>The <code>abstract</code> Keyword</h3>
		<p>
			We're on the right track!  This code is still kind of specific, however. We assume that
			all pets walk in the positive x direction, which is an incorrect assumption. How do we make
			this code less specific while still making <pygm>WalkingPet</pygm>s walkable? To do this, we
			must introduce a new keyword, called <pygm>abstract</pygm>. Let's rewrite WalkingPet using this
			keyword.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			abstract class WalkingPet {
				private int x;
				private int y;
				private int z;
				
				public abstract void walk();
				
				// Accessors and Mutators omitted for clarity
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			If we could give our classes voices at this point, the conversation would go something like this: <br /> <br />
			Dog: Hey, WalkingPet, I want you to walk for me. <br />
			WalkingPet: Sorry, Dog. (no pun intended.) I don't know how to walk. <br />
			Dog: Bummer dude. I guess I'll figure it out. <br /> <br />
			
			By declaring <pygm>walk</pygm> <pygm>abstract</pygm>, we've effectively deferred the responsibility of implementing <pygm>walk</pygm>
			to the classes that extend <pygm>WalkingPet</pygm>, namely <pygm>Dog</pygm> and <pygm>Cat</pygm>. Note that if a class has any
			<pygm>abstract</pygm> members, we must put the <pygm>abstract</pygm> keyword before the <pygm>class</pygm> keyword as well.
			Let's attempt to redefine the <pygm>Dog</pygm> and <pygm>Cat</pygm> classes to implement <pygm>walk</pygm>:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class Dog extends WalkingPet {
				private String color; // Holds the dog's color
				
				public void bark() {
					System.out.println("Woof!"); // Print "Woof"
				}
				
				public void walk() {
					x++; // Our dog walks like usual
				}
			}
			
			class Cat extends WalkingPet {
				private int lives = 9;
				
				public int getLives() {
					return lives;
				}
				
				public void loseLives(int num) {
					lives = lives - num;
				}
				
				public void walk() {
					y--; // Our cat walks in the negative y direction
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<h3>The <code>protected</code> Keyword</h3>
		<p>
			This code looks innocent enough, but it has a problem. Neither
			<pygm>Dog</pygm> nor <pygm>Cat</pygm> can access the position instance variables,
			because those are declared <pygm>private</pygm> within <pygm>WalkingPet</pygm>.
			There are two options here. Either we change the visibility of the position instance
			variables, or we use the public accessors and mutators. To use the accessors and mutators,
			we would simply replace <pygm>x++;</pygm> with <pygm>setX(getX() + 1);</pygm>. This isn't
			preferred, however, since this is both slower and uglier than <pygm>x++;</pygm>. So, how do
			we make instance variables directly accessible to children classes, but not to outsiders? This
			is where the keyword <pygm>protected</pygm> comes into play. If we simply redefine our position
			variables to be  <pygm>protected</pygm> rather than <pygm>private</pygm>, our code will be
			pretty, fast, and visibility will remain internal only. Let's do that now.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			abstract class WalkingPet {
				protected int x;
				protected int y;
				protected int z;
				
				public abstract void walk();
				
				// Accessors and Mutators omitted for clarity
			}
		</pygments>
		<h3>The <code>static</code> keyword</h3>
		<p>
			The <pygm>static</pygm> modifier makes a variable or method similar to a global variable or function in C.
			Even though these static members are still members of classes, they are very different from their instance
			brethren. In a static method, you cannot use an instance variable. However, you may use static methods and
			variables in instance methods and instance variables.
		</p>
		<p>
			Usually we prefer instance over static members, however, there are times that static members are very useful.
			Imagine we are trying to write a class in which every object has a unique id. We could do something like this:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class ObjectWithID {
				private static int i = 1;
				private static int generateUniqueID() {
					return i++;
				}
				
				private int id = generateUniqueID();
				
				public int getUniqueID() {
					return id;
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			The first object constructed will have the id of 1, the second will have
			an id of 2, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the static member is public, we must use a slight variant of the dot operator we've
			grown used to. Instead of calling the dot operator with a variable, we call it with the
			class's full name. For example:
		<pygments>
			class IntegerHelpers {
				public static int roundTo(int num, int value) {
					return num - num % value;
				}
			}
			
			class Main {
				public static void main(String[] main) {
					int input = 462;
					int roundedToFive = IntegerHelpers.roundTo(input, 5); // == 460
					System.out.println("The number " + input + " rounded to five is " + roundedToFive);
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<h3>Constructors</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes we need to "set up" an object before it is ready for use. Let's say we wanted our <pygm>Dog</pygm>
			to have an associated <pygm>name</pygm> property. We could write a mutator that modified the <pygm>name</pygm>
			variable, but names rarely change, so providing a mutator might be an incorrect solution to our 
			problem. Instead, we can use something called a constructor, which is a special type of method called when
			we bring an object into existence using the <pygm>new</pygm> keyword.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			class Dog extends WalkingPet {
				private String name;
				
				public Dog(String newName) { // This is a constructor
					name = newName;
				}
				
				public String getName() {
					return name;
				}
				
				// Other members omitted for clarity
			}
			
			....
			
			Dog buddy = new Dog("Buddy");
			System.out.println("The dog's name is " + buddy.getName());
		</pygments>
		<p>
			There are a few things to note from the code listing above. The first is the declaration of the constructor.
			Constructors cannot not have a return type, so the return type is omitted. The name of the constructor must also
			exactly match the name of the class. Finally, we use the constructor by supplying parameters for use with the <pygm>new</pygm>
			operator.
		</p>

		<h1>CBCJVM Programmers Manual</h1>
		<center><img src="CBCJava_64.png" alt="CBCJVM Logo"/></center>
		<br/>
		<p>
			This document assumes you have a decent understanding of Java and
			CBC development in C. CBCJVM is an Object Oriented library for CBC
			development in Java. Started in 2009 as an open source project, the
			project quickly grew as students and professionals contributed to
			its codebase. Now, after years development, CBCJVM has been included
			in the official CBC firmware.
		</p>
		<p>
			Java and CBCJVM allow rapid and professional development of robot
			programs. This document hopes to serve as a guide to understanding
			CBCJVM and its usage.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> <i>CBCJVM's APIs are subject to change in the future,
			so if a future release of CBCJVM breaks your code, don't say we
			didn't warn you! That said, we'll try to keep major changes to a
			minimum and documentation up-to-date.</i>
		</p>
		<h2>Things That Move (<code>cbccore.motors.*</code>)</h2>
		<h3>Motors (<code>cbccore.motors.Motor</code>)</h3>
		<p>
			Individual motors are creating instances of the
			<pygm>cbccore.motors.Motor</pygm> class. The <pygm>Motor</pygm>
			class has a significant amount of similarity to libcbc. For example,
			if we wished to move motor on port 0 at a specific velocity for 1
			second, we could use the <pygm>moveAtVelocity</pygm> method in
			<pygm>Motor</pygm>.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.motors.Motor;
			public class MotorTest {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Motor test = new Motor(0);
					test.moveAtVelocity(150);
					try {
						Thread.sleep(1000);
					} catch(InterruptedException e) {
						e.printStackTrace();
					} 
					test.off();
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			If you've programmed a CBC in C before, the method
			<pygm>moveAtVelocity</pygm> should look somewhat familiar. In C, we
			can use the <pygm language="c">move_at_velocity</pygm> or
			<pygm>mav</pygm> functions to achieve a similar effect. In CBCJVM,
			though, we don't have to supply a port to the method. The
			<pygm>Motor</pygm> class stores the port we supplied to it in the
			constructor, cleaning our code both syntactically and conceptually.
		</p>
		The next bit of code sleeps for one second (1000 milliseconds.)
		<pygments>
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch(InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			While this code is somewhat verbose, this is the standard way to
			"sleep" for a given amount of time in Java. As such, we will
			continue to use it in this manual. If you wish, you may encapsulate
			this code in a separate method to clean up your logic. However, most
			code in CBCJVM is reaction based, so sleeping occurs less often than
			one may think in nontrivial samples.
		</p>
		<p>
			A full listing of methods provided by
			<pygm>cbccore.motors.Motor</pygm> can be found in CBCJVM's JavaDoc
			documentation.
		</p>
		<h3>Servos (<code>cbccore.motors.Servo</code>)</h3>
		<p>
			Servos are also very simple to use in CBCJVM. In the following
			example, we will quickly move a servo on port 0 to position 500,
			then smoothly move it to 1000 over a period of 5 seconds. CBCJVM
			does quite a bit of work behind the scenes to accomplish this for
			us.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.motors.Servo;
			
			public class ServoTest {
				public static void msleep(long ms) {
					try {
						Thread.sleep(ms);
					} catch(InterruptedException e) {
						e.printStackTrace();
					}
				}
			
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Servo test = new Servo(0);
					test.enable();
					test.setPosition(500); // Move servo to 500 like in C
					msleep(1000); // Wait one second
					// smoothly move servo to a new position over 5 seconds
					test.setPositionTime(1000, 5000, true);
					test.disable();
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Be careful about defining multiple <pygm>Servo</pygm> objects for
			the same physical servo. Controlling it simultaneously from multiple
			objects could have unintended consequences. For this reason, try to
			match no more than one CBCJVM <pygm>Servo</pygm> object with each
			hardware servo.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's take a closer look at <pygm>setPositionTime</pygm>. CBCJVM
			defines the method like this: <pygm>setPositionTime(int newPos,
			int ms, boolean blocking)</pygm>. The first parameter is the new
			absolute position of the servo, just as in <pygm>setPosition</pygm>.
			The next parameter is the time to move over, in milliseconds. The
			next parameter is called <pygm>blocking</pygm>. In programming, a
			function is blocking if it waits for its operation to finish. For
			example, if we wrote a sample program to compute the value of pi, we
			may write the following:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			public class ComputePi {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					System.out.println("Computing Pi...");
					computePi();
					System.out.println("Done!");
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Realistically, this function might take a significant amount of time
			to finish its computation. In the <b>blocking</b> scenario, the text
			"Done!" wouldn't print until the calculation finished. However, if
			the method is <b>nonblocking</b>, "Done!" will print immediately. A
			blocking function halts execution until it is finished, while a
			nonblocking function allows execution to continue. In both cases, pi
			will be computed, but in the nonblocking scenario we don't wait for
			it to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since both scenarios have their obvious uses, CBCJVM allows the
			programmer to pick. In our example, we block. Otherwise, we would be
			disabling the servo before the servo finished moving, which wouldn't
			produce the desired behavior.
		</p>
		<h2>Sensors (<code>cbccore.sensors.*</code>)</h2>
		<p>
			CBCJVM sensors are slightly less straightforward than what we've
			learned so far. Sensors are based off of two core abstractions, that
			of the <pygm>IBooleanSensor</pygm> and the
			<pygm>IAnalogSensor</pygm>. All other sensors and sensor decorators
			are based off of these two classes. For now, we will discuss the two
			of them separately.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Boolean Sensors
			(<code>cbccore.sensors.digital.*</code>)
		</h3>
		<p>
			A Boolean sensor can be defined very simply: Anything that can
			return a true or a false. The method we call to determine this state
			is called <pygm>getValue</pygm> All digital sensors fall under this
			category, so we will discuss them first. In the following example,
			we will wait for a touch sensor on port 15 to be pressed before
			printing a message.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.sensors.digital.*;
			
			public class TouchSensors {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Touch sensor = new Touch(15);
					while(!sensor.getValue()) Thread.yield(); // Wait until sensor is pressed
					System.out.println("Touched!"); // Code executed after sensor is pressed
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			You may be wondering what <pygm>Thread.yield</pygm> does. Why didn't
			we just use <pygm>
				while(!sensor.getValue());
			</pygm>? To understand why, let's take a look at a slightly more
			complicated scenario. Let's say that CBCJVM was smoothly moving a
			servo for you, and you chose to continue code execution
			(nonblocking.) CBCJVM is able to do this by running a thread called
			<pygm>ServoThread</pygm> in the background, which updates the servo
			on your behalf. Now your program has two "threads" of execution. One
			of these is your main method, and the other is the ServoThread. If
			we simply do <pygm>
				while(!sensor.getValue());
			</pygm>, we've effectively locked out other threads from using the
			processor. As a result, servo movement will be anything but smooth.
			Since the thread updating the servo on our behalf can no longer do
			its job, the servo will move in a sporadic manner.
			<pygm>Thread.yield</pygm> solves this issue, by effectively telling
			Java we aren't doing anything important, so give the processor to
			another thread. Our <pygm>ServoThread</pygm> continues to run as a
			result, and our servo smoothly moves to where we told it! This is a
			good habit to get into.
		</p>
		<h4>User Input (<code>cbccore.sensors.buttons.*</code>)</h4>
		<p>
			In addition to handlers for various physical sensors, CBCJVM
			includes a set of classes allowing one to treat cbcui's buttons as
			digital sensors. For example, we can slightly modify the above code
			to use the a-button instead of a touch sensor.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.sensors.buttons.*;
			
			public class ButtonDemo {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					AButton button = new AButton(); // No port number is needed
					while(!button.getValue()) Thread.yield(); // Wait until button is pressed
					System.out.println("Pressed!"); // Code executed after button is pressed
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Taking things one step further, we can use some-button specific
			methods, defined by the <pygm>AbstractButton</pygm> class, changing
			the line
		</p>
		<pygments>
			while(!button.getValue()) Thread.yield();
		</pygments>
		<p>
			to the more readable
		</p>
		<pygments>
			while(button.isNotPressed()) Thread.yield();
		</pygments>
		<h3>Analog Sensors (<code>cbccore.sensors.analog.*</code>)</h3>
		<p>
			Analog sensors, such as distance or light sensors are dealt with
			similarly to boolean sensors, however the sensor values are
			naturally given as integers rather than booleans.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two main functions for deriving value from an Analog
			sensor object. Like in the C-library, where there are the
			<pygm language="c">analog</pygm> and
			<pygm language="c">analog10</pygm> functions, CBCJVM has
			<pygm>getValue<pygm> and <pygm>getValueHigh</pygm> methods. In
			CBCJVM, <pygm>getValue</pygm> is allowed, but explicitly deprecated
			in favor of <pygm>getValueHigh</pygm>. This is because it has
			reduced precision with no benefits, however having it may be useful
			when porting old C-code over to CBCJVM. If you compile code using
			<pygm>getValue</pygm>, you will receive a deprecation warning.
		</p>
		<p>
			The CBC's floating mode allows one to work with certain pieces of
			hardware, such as the ET Sensor. KISS-C's API requires one to set
			the floating mode for all sensors at once. CBCJVM improves upon this
			API slightly, allowing you to set each sensor individually through
			<pygm>cbccore.sensors.analog.Analog</pygm>'s
			<pygm>setFloating</pygm> method, doing the required work for you in
			the background. To enable floating mode, you could simply execute a
			line of code such as:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			mySensor.setFloating(true);
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Disabling floating mode would be as simple as passing
			<pygm>false</pygm> instead. Floating mode is off by default.
		</p>
		<p>
			What follows is a simple program to read an analog sensor, such as
			a top-hat sensor, plugged into port 6 multiple times, averaging the
			results together and printing them out.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.sensors.analog.*;
			import cbccore.sensors.buttons.AButton;
			
			public class SensorReader {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					// Wait for user input before we start
					AButton button = new AButton();
					System.out.println("Press the \"A\" button to begin!")
					while(!button.getValue()) Thread.yield(); // Wait until button is pressed
					// Initialize our variables used
					int sum = 0;
					int numberOfReadings = 15;
					Analog sensor = new Analog(6);
					// Perform the reading
					for(int i = 0; i < numberOfReadings; ++i) {
						sum += sensor.getValueHigh();
					}
					int average = Math.round((double)sum / numberOfReadings);
					System.out.println("I recorded a value of " + average);
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<h4>ET Sensors (<code>cbccore.sensors.analog.ETSensor</code>)</h4>
		<p>
			ET Sensors tend to be complicated, requiring intricate calibration,
			as values they give roughly fit a power model, instead of being
			linear. The <pygm>ETSensor</pygm> can take calibration information,
			use it to generate distances in centimeters. Additionally, the
			ETSensor class automatically sets the proper port to floating mode
			for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			To get started quickly, one can use the default calibration values:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.sensors.analog.ETSensor;
			
			public class SimpleETDistanceFinder {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					ETSensor sensor = new ETSensor(6); // Let's say it's in port 6
					// Make five readings averaged together, waiting 10ms between each one:
					double distanceCm = sensor.getCm(5, 10);
					System.out.println("The nearest object is about " + distanceCm +
					                   " centimeters away");
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			For calibration values specific to your sensor, you can use a tool
			like
			<a href="kiss://openfile#targets/java/templates/ETCalibrator/bin/
			Main.java">the example ET calibrator</a>. It will ask you to move an
			object various distances away from the ET sensor, and then it will
			calibrate around those experimental values. You can optimize about
			specific distances by modifying the <pygm>distances</pygm> array in
			the program. This should give you an output like:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			bestPow: 1.23
			bestK: 29470
			bestB: -.00448
			with deviation: 0.01
		</pygments>
		<p>
			Which then can be mapped to the constructor like:
			<pygm>new ETSensor(port, 29470, 1.23, -.00448)</pygm>, where
			<pygm>port</pygm> is the port that the ET sensor is plugged into.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Using Analog Sensors like Digital Sensors, or <i>I Can't Believe
			it's not Boolean!</i>
			(<code>cbccore.sensors.analog.AnalogBooleanAdapter</code>)
		</h4>
		<p>
			A common goal when using analog sensors is to have them act around a
			specific pivot point. In this case, while you are working with an
			analog sensor, you are conceptually treating it like a boolean one.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <pygm>AnalogBooleanAdapter</pygm> class can take a
			<pygm>Analog</pygm> sensor object, and let you treat it like a
			<pygm>cbccore.sensors.digital.IBooleanSensor</pygm> object. For
			example, you can construct an instance like
		</p>
		<pygments>
			Analog baseLightSensor = new Analog(6);
			IBooleanSensor lightSensor = new AnalogBooleanAdapter(baseLightSensor, 50);
		</pygments>
		<p>
			This will make a virtual boolean sensor out of the analog sensor in
			port 6. When <pygm>baseLightSensor.getValueHigh()</pygm> gives a
			value <u>greater than or equal to</u> 50,
			<pygm>lightSensor.getValue()</pygm> will give a value of
			<pygm>true</pygm>. As a convenience,
			<pygm>AnalogBooleanAdapter</pygm> can be constructed with a
			<pygm>reverseCondition</pygm> argument. Constructing an
			<pygm>AnalogBooleanAdapter</pygm> instance like
		</p>
		<pygments>
			IBooleanSensor lightSensor = new AnalogBooleanAdapter(baseLightSensor, 50, true);
		</pygments>
		<p>
			would make <pygm>lightSensor.getValue()</pygm> give a value of
			<pygm>true</pygm> when <pygm>baseLightSensor.getValueHigh()</pygm>
			gives a value <u>less than</u> 50.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some cases, a virtual boolean device can improve readability,
			such as in the following example.
		</p>
		<pygments>
			while(!lightSensor.getValue()) Thread.yield(); // Wait until light turns on
		</pygments>
		<p>
			However, the real power of the <pygm>AnalogBooleanAdapter</pygm>
			class becomes apparent when used with an event system.
		</p>
		<h1>Eventing (<code>cbccore.events</code>)</h1>
		<p>
			An event-system flips the way one handles changes in a system. The
			traditional way of receiving information on these events is through
			<b>polling</b>. An example of this can be seen in the following
			code:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			while(!button.getValue()) Thread.yield(); // Wait until button is pressed
		</pygments>
		<p>
			This code gets the job done, but it sure is expensive, and we can't
			easily do anything else while the code is running (the code is
			blocking).
		</p>
		<p>
			Now imagine if we had the sensor, the button (or whatever else you
			can think of that might have a state that changes), <i>called
			us</i>. We could write code on how to pick up the (metaphorical)
			phone and respond, but we could do things in the meantime. We
			wouldn't have to worry about waiting for an action, and if we
			wanted, we could sit <i>completely idle</i>, consuming almost no CPU
			cycles if we wanted to, with no need to perform expensive polling.
			CBCJVM's event system attempts to provide the mechanisms needed for
			this type of "callback" setup.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> <i>While it would be ideal to have a sensor or button
			notify us, the KISS-C API doesn't allow for exactly that. Therefore,
			polling must occur for those specific cases. For buttons and
			sensors, where there is no choice but to poll, CBCJVM performs the
			polling in the background, but in the most efficient way
			possible.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			When it comes to CBCJVM's event system, there are four major
			constructs: <pygm>Event</pygm> objects, <pygm>EventType</pygm>
			objects, <pygm>IEventListener<pygm> instances, and the
			<pygm>EventManager</pygm>. A developer first "connects" an
			<pygm>IEventListener</pygm> instance to an
			<pygm>EventManager</pygm>, specifying an <pygm>EventType</pygm>.
			Later on, if an emitter, such as
			<pygm>cbccore.sensors.buttons.ButtonEmitter</pygm> notices a state
			change, it will create a new <pygm>Event</pygm> object, and emit it
			using the <pygm>EventManager</pygm>. When the
			<pygm>EventManager</pygm> receives this emitted event, it then
			broadcasts it to any listeners connected to the event's
			<pygm>EventType</pygm>.
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of this can be seen in an example button-listening
			system: <a href="kiss://openfile#targets/java/templates/Buttons/bin/
			Main.java">(also included in CBCJVM's examples)</a>
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.Device;
			import cbccore.events.Event;
			import cbccore.events.EventManager;
			import cbccore.events.EventListenerAdapter;
			import cbccore.sensors.buttons.ButtonEmitter;
			
			public class EventingButtonHandler {
				
				public void run() {
					EventManager manager = EventManager.get();
					ButtonEmitter.get().start();
					
					
					EventListenerAdapter AButtonPressedHandler = new EventListenerAdapter() {
						@Override
						public void event(Event type) {
							System.out.println("The A Button Was Pressed!");
						}
					};
					
					EventListenerAdapter AButtonReleasedHandler = new EventListenerAdapter() {
						@Override
						public void event(Event type) {
							System.out.println("The A Button Was Released!");
						}
					};
					
					manager.connect(ButtonEmitter.AButtonPressed, AButtonPressedHandler);
					manager.connect(ButtonEmitter.AButtonReleased, AButtonReleasedHandler);
				}
				
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					cbccore.Device.init();
					System.out.println("Press the A button.");
					new EventingButtonHandler().run();
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<p>
			You'll find that for complicated problems, or where performance is
			important, CBCJVM's event system can be handy. But the event system
			inevitably adds some overhead, and requires some boilerplate code,
			making it less than ideal in some simple cases. Therefore, the
			decision of when to use, and when not to use the event system lies
			with the end developer.
		</p>
		<h1>High-Level Navigation (<code>cbccore.movement</code>)</h1>
		<p>
			CBCJVM comes with a very high-level navigation library allowing a
			user to move a dual-wheel drive system by issuing commands such as
			<pygm>moveCm(5, getMaxCmps())</pygm>, which would move a properly
			calibrated robot 5 centimeters at the maximum possible speed.
		</p>
		<h2>Constructing a <code>DriveTrain</code> Instance</h2>
		<p>
			The APIs for dealing with creates and traditional motor-based
			drive-trains are significantly different. To mitigate this problem,
			CBCJVM's movement library utilizes a plugin system. When defining a
			plugin, one simply tells the movement library how to perform some
			very basic tasks, such as driving the left and right wheels at given
			speeds. Additionally, plugins provide the <pygm>DriveTrain</pygm>
			information on the physical dimensions of the robot, which may be
			needed for turning.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before we can construct an instance of <pygm>DriveTrain</pygm>, we
			must first construct a plugin for it. Fortunately, plugin classes
			are already defined for create and traditional two-wheel based lego
			drive-train robots.
		</p>
		<h3>Making a New <code>CreateMovementPlugin</code> Instance</h3>
		<p>
			The <code>CreateMovementPlugin</code> class is very easy to
			instantiate, requiring no measurements, only an instance of a
			<pygm>cbccore.create.Create</pygm> object. A <pygm>Create</pygm>
			object can be created with no arguments, or with an optional "lag"
			argument, which maps to KISS-C's related function arguments,
			representing the number of seconds to wait between sensor updates.
			If no argument is specified, a lag of 0 is given.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only catch here, is that either the <pygm>Create</pygm> or the
			<pygm>CreateMovementPlugin</pygm> constructors could throw a
			<pygm>cbccore.create.CreateConnectException</pygm>, as they attempt
			to automatically connect to the create. Because of this, we must
			form a try-catch block around our initialization code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is an example of a program to construct a new
			<pygm>CreateMovementPlugin</pygm>, and nothing else:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.movement.plugins.MovementPlugin;
			import cbccore.movement.plugins.create.CreateMovementPlugin;
			import cbccore.create.Create;
			import cbccore.create.CreateConnectException;
			
			public class CreateMovementPluginConstructionTest {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					MovementPlugin plugin = null;
					try {
						plugin = new CreateMovementPlugin(new Create());
					} catch(CreateConnectException e) {
						System.out.println("Create failed to connect.");
						System.exit(1);
					}
					// you could then construct a DriveTrain with the plugin and do
					// something interesting
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<h3>Making a New <code>MotorMovementPlugin</code> Instance</h3>
		<p>
			A <pygm>MotorMovementPlugin</pygm> represents a traditional
			two-wheeled lego robot, powered by two separate drive motors.
		</p>
		<p>
			<pygm>cbccore.movement.plugins.motor.MotorMovementPlugin</pygm>
			objects are a bit more complicated to construct, as they require a
			few measurements; wheel circumferences, and the distance between the
			two wheels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wheel circumferences are provided through
			<pygm>cbccore.movement.plugins.motor.Wheel</pygm> objects.
			<pygm>Wheel</pygm> objects are constructed with a port and a
			circumference in centimeters (everything in
			<pygm>cbccore.movement</pygm> uses centimeters). The distance
			between the two wheels is provided in the
			<pygm>MotorMovementPlugin</pygm> constructor itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is an example of a program to construct a new
			<pygm>MotorMovementPlugin</pygm>, and nothing else:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			import cbccore.movement.plugins.MovementPlugin;
			import cbccore.movement.plugins.motor.Wheel;
			import cbccore.movement.plugins.motor.MotorMovementPlugin;
			
			public class MotorMovementPluginConstructionTest {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					// Let's pretend we have a robot with a left wheel motor plugged into
					// port 0, and a right wheel motor plugged into port 1. The
					// circumference for both wheels is 14.5 cm. The distance between the
					// wheels is 9.2 cm.
					MovementPlugin plugin = new MotorMovementPlugin(
						new Wheel(0, 14.5), new Wheel(1, 14.5), 9.2
					);
					// you could then construct a DriveTrain with the plugin and do
					// something interesting
				}
			}
		</pygments>
		<h3>Putting Things Together</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have a plugin, we can construct a
			<pygm>DriveTrain</pygm> instance. The constructor requires the
			plugin and nothing else. Given a plugin named <pygm>plugin</pygm>,
			constructing a <pygm>DriveTrain</pygm> (assuming you've already
			imported <pygm>cbccore.movement.DriveTrain</pygm>) is as simple as
		</p>
		<pygments>
			DriveTrain dt = new DriveTrain(plugin);
		</pygments>
		<h2>Using Your New <code>DriveTrain</code></h2>
		<p>
			There are a variety of methods that can be used with the
			<pygm>DriveTrain</pygm> class. For the full listing, check the
			JavaDoc page for the class. We'll cover the most basic movements
			here: driving straight, and turning.
		</p>
		<h3>Moving Straight</h3>
		<p>
			One of the simplest conceivable programs for a robot is simply to
			have it drive straight an arbitrary distance. CBCJVM's
			<pygm>moveCm(cm, cmps)</pygm> allows you to do just this. The only
			issue to solve, is the right cmps to move at. Often, one will want
			to move at a proportion of the maximum speed of the robot. The
			<pygm>DriveTrain</pygm> class defines two methods to help with this,
			<pygm>getMaxCmps()</pygm> and <pygm>getMinCmps()</pygm>. The first
			gets the maximum forward speed in centimeters-per-second of the
			robot. The second gets the maximum backwards speed of the robot.
			Multiplying the returned value of these methods with a proportion
			will give a speed in proportion to the maximum speed of the robot.

		<p>
			Given a <pygm>DriveTrain</pygm> object, <pygm>dt</pygm>, you could
			move the robot forward one meter at half speed with the line of
			code,
		</p>
		<pygments>
			dt.moveCm(100., dt.getMaxCmps() * 0.5);
		</pygments>
		<p>
			and backwards with the line of code,
		</p>
		<pygments>
			dt.moveCm(-100., dt.getMinCmps() * 0.5);
		</pygments>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> <i>As our second argument is speed and not velocity,
			sign doesn't matter, but it is typically customary with CBCJVM, and
			often more readable, to give the displacement and speed arguments
			matching signs.</i>
		</p>
		<h3>Rotating in Place</h3>
		<p>
			Often times, the next step in navigation is to rotate a robot in
			place. The <pygm>rotateDegrees(degrees, degreesPerSecond)</pygm> and
			<pygm>rotateRadians(radians, radiansPerSecond)</pygm> methods can do
			just that. The first argument's sign specifies the direction to
			turn: counter-clockwise when positive, and clockwise when negative.
			The <pygm>getMaxDegreesPerSec()</pygm>,
			<pygm>getMinDegreesPerSec()</pygm>,
			<pygm>getMaxRadiansPerSec()</pygm>, and
			<pygm>getMinRadiansPerSec()</pygm> can aid with determining a good
			rotational speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Making a 90-degree left turn at half-speed is as simple as
		</p>
		<pygments>
			dt.rotateDegrees(90., dt.getMaxDegreesPerSec() * 0.5);
		</pygments>
		<p>
			and making a 90-degree right turn at half-speed can be done with
		</p>
		<pygments>
			dt.rotateDegrees(-90., dt.getMinDegreesPerSec() * 0.5);
		</pygments>
		<h1>Botball Specific Tools (<code>cbccore.Botball</code>)</h1>
		<p>
			CBCJVM contains a couple of standard tools for botball tournaments,
			similar to KISS-C.
		</p>
		<p>
			After importing <pygm>cbccore.Botball</pygm> and
			<pygm>cbccore.sensors.analog.Analog</pygm>, waiting for a light can
			be accomplished with the following line of code:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			Botball.waitForLight(new Analog(0)); // assume port 0 for light sensor
		</pygments>
		<p>
			A failsafe, disabling the robot after a fixed period can be enabled
			with the following line of code:
		</p>
		<pygments>
			new Botball().shutDownIn(115.0); // force stop after 115 seconds after this line
			                                 // of code is executed
		</pygments>
		<h1>Ending Notes</h1>
		<p>
			Hopefully that's enough to get you started! Despite the length of
			this document, we've only begun to scratch the surface. Java itself
			is a massive language, with one of the largest standard language
			libraries in existence!
		</p>
		<p>
			From here, we'd recommend you take a look at the CBCJVM JavaDoc
			documentation, and perhaps even the
			<a href="https://github.com/CBCJVM/CBCJVM">CBCJVM source code
			itself!</a> If you find a bug in CBCJVM, or would like a new
			feature, feel free to either
			<a href="https://github.com/CBCJVM/CBCJVM/issues">request it</a>, or
			(even better) fix or add it yourself. CBCJVM is always welcoming of
			new developers, even if you aren't the most experienced.
